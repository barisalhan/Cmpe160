# Cmpe160-TeachingAssistantProject

This is a project that simulates a typical library with daily ongoing operations. I have developed this project in Java while I was a teaching assistant in Cmpe160-Object Oriented Programming. After deleting some parts of the code, it is given to students as a homework project to complete the missing parts.

In the file structure, the first folder is the code that I wrote, the second folder is the deleted version of the project that is given
to students. The last one is the testing folders. I wrote testing by using JUnit test.

Furthermore, I wrote the documentation that was given to students.
