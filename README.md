# Cmpe160-TeachingAssistantProject

This is a project that simulates a typical library with daily ongoing operations. I have developed this project while I was a teaching
assistant in Cmpe160-Object Oriented Programming. After deleting some parts of the code, it is given to students as a homework project
to complete the missing parts.
